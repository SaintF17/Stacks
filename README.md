# CS2063 - Team 9 Final Project

## **Budget My Stacks**

A lightweight budgeting app for Android, allowing the user to input
expenses either manually or with a Photo of a receipt; from which
categories can be chosen and tracked to help improve the user's 
view of their financial life.

### Installation Instructions

This repo can be cloned, then imported into Android Studio as a gradle 
project. The user then needs to either connect a phone over ADB or emulator to which the app is built then sent. Expect a longer build/import time in Android Studio when first running the application.


### Known Issues: 

Whenever inputting a custom expense, whether manually or OCR, it must be an integer; same goes when setting a budget limit on first category setup.
